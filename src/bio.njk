<h2>I will say it again....</h2>
<h1>I am <em>Denzel Moises Echevarria</em></h1>
<section class="content-holder">
    <p>With a <em>strong affinity for technology</em> I dove head first into the community, traveling to participate in events with the goal of growing my community presence and developing my skillset. Having formed strong bonds through the community I became an internet personality on streaming platforms, merging different communities with my own. While using OBS I grew intrigued by web extensions, manipulating my stream overlays for a professional aesthetic. The knowledge gained allowed me to <em>give back to the community</em> and aid others to improve their streaming quality. After a while I found myself interested in open source software, and before I knew it I was diving into web development, ready to share my personality and spread joy to my surroundings.</p>
