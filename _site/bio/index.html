<h1>I am Denzel Moises Echevarria</h1>
<section class="content-holder">
    <p>With a strong affinity for technology I dove head first into the community, traveling to participate in events with the goal of growing my community presence and developing my skillset. Having formed strong bonds through the community I became an internet personality on streaming platforms, merging different communities with my own.</p>

    <p> While using OBS I grew intrigued by web extensions, manipulating my stream overlays for a professional aesthetic. The knowledge gained allowed me to give back to the community and aid others to improve their streaming quality. After a while I found myself interested in open source software, and before I knew I was diving into web development, ready to share my personality and spread joy to my surroundings.</p>
